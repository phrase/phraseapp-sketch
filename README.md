# phraseapp-sketch

The PhraseApp Sketch plugin allows you to sync the content from your Sketch designs directly from within Sketch to your PhraseApp project. Translate this content in PhraseApp right away and and sync it back to Sketch once it's completed. 

Collaborate efficiently at an early stage of development to avoid surprises in your design later on. Establish a continuous sync between Sketch and PhraseApp and optimize your design content for multiple languages.
