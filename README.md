# Phrase Sketch plugin

The Phrase Sketch plugin lets you sync the content from your Sketch designs directly from within Sketch to your Phrase project. Translate content in Phrase right away and and sync it back to Sketch once it's completed. 

Collaborate efficiently at an early stage of development to avoid surprises in your design later on. Establish a continuous sync between Sketch and Phrase and optimize your design content for multiple languages.
